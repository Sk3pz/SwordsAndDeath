# SwordsAndDeath
A tiny MMO RPG game server written in rust with several clients.\
This includes the code for the server as well as the official client.\
While the Swords and Death client is provided for download on the website, SnD has been designed for the creation of
other clients. One example of this is the discord bot in development that will allow users to play SnD in a discord
server with their friends.\
If you don't like the current look and feel of the client, you can fork it and customize it to your liking, or code one
from scratch using the documentation on our website!
